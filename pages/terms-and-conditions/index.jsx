              <h4>ABOUT THE PLATFORM</h4>
              <p>
                Our Platform is built to create a decentralised community of gamers
                which acts as distribution platform for global and Indian games.
                Multiple Quests and Tournaments are organised on the Platform that a
                User can participate for free, either individually or as part of a
                Clan, to earn benefits. Users can also receive reward points called
                IndiGG Reward Points that have multiple use cases on the Platform. We
                may, at our sole discretion, live stream any or all gameplay activity
                of Users
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Platform is built to create a community of gamers who can
                  participate in a variety of Web3 and Web2 games ("Partner Games”)
                  offered by global game developers and publishers integrated on the
                  Platform (“Game Partners”). IndiGG reserves an unconditional right
                  to add, remove, restrict, or disable Your access to Partner Games
                  at its sole discretion without any prior notice to You. We are not
                  liable in the event You suffer any loss or damage by Your inability
                  to access or participate in any Partner Game on the Platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users can participate in games offered on the Platform, as
                  freelance agents, either individually or as part of a Clan (defined
                  below) in accordance with the requirements and conditions
                  prescribed by the Platform from time to time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each Game Partner on the Platform may display certain tasks and
                  activities in relation to its Partner Game that a User needs to
                  complete by engaging and participating in the Partner Game
                  ("Quests”). In addition, from time to time, certain tournaments and
                  competitions may also be organised on the Platform, either by the
                  Game Partner, IndiGG, or the Clan Chief (defined below) where Users
                  compete with other Users on the Platform ("Tournaments”).
                  Participation in Quests and Tournaments is free to all Users and
                  may be subject to certain rules and conditions, which each User
                  needs to abide by (respectively “Quest Rules” and “Tournament
                  Rules”)

                  You agree that IndiGG reserves the right, at its sole discretion,
                  to record and live stream Your engagement with any Quests,
                  Tournaments, or similar gameplay on the Platform ("Live Streams”).
                  You hereby consent that IndiGG may use any or all Live Streams at
                  its absolute discretion and You expressly waive any rights that You
                  may have, including intellectual property rights, in any such Live
                  Stream. IndiGG reserves the right to abandon a specific Live Stream
                  or adjust the deadline of a Live Stream at its discretion
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apart from the Game Partners, IndiGG may also avail the services of
                  third parties for operating the Platform and offering its Services
                  to You (“Service Providers”). Your use of services offered by such
                  Service Providers is independent and separate from Your use of our

                  Service Provider without any liability to Us.

                  Withdrawal of Earnings: IndiGG will assist Users to withdraw their
