                  IndiGG is committed to carrying on its business in accordance with
                  the highest ethical and business standards. This includes complying

                <li>
                  IndiGG understands that money laundering undermines legitimate
                  business activities, facilitates and breeds corruption, damages the
                  legitimate rights and interests of Users, and severely impacts the
                  functioning and perception of the digital economy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  IndiGG has formulated this AML and KYC Policy, to be read along
                  with the Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, to prevent money
                  laundering and terrorist financing and fully comply with Applicable

              <ol>
                <li>
                  IndiGG takes reasonable and industry-standard measures to establish

                <li>
                  IndiGG, with the help of its Service Providers, collects User
                  identification details from each User, including but not limited to
