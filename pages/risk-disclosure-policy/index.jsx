                  You understand, agree and acknowledge that Web3 gaming transactions
                  and cryptocurrencies may be unregulated in certain jurisdictions
                  and can be highly risky. You assume full responsibility to

                  in such transactions at your own interests and risks. There may be
                  no regulatory recourse available from any loss that You may incur

              <h4>INHERENT RISKS</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Volatility of Web3 digital assets: The prices and liquidity of
                  blockchain assets are extremely volatile and subjective. They have
                  no inherent or intrinsic value, and fluctuations in the price of
                  other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the
                  value of such digital assets. The value of Web3 digital assets that
                  you may receive as Earnings through Yor use of the Platform is
                  inherently subjective and factors occurring outside Our control may
                  materially impact their value.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Frauds and cyber-attacks: While We try Our best to deploy industry
                  standard cybersecurity practices in securing Our Platform and Your
                  User Account, instances of fraud, cyberattacks, and counterfeiting
                  are common practice in the digital world. Any such frauds or
                  cyberattacks may result in total loss of Your User Account and We
                  shall not be liable for the same. We shall not be liable for User
                  losses on account of any of the foregoing circumstances or
                  compromised User Account credentials.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Interference and interception: Internet-based communications are
                  susceptible to interference or interception by third parties. Such
                  interference or interception may include hacking, distributed
                  denials of service or errors, malicious exploitation of defects or
                  vulnerabilities associated with the source codes associated with
                  the Platform. We shall not be liable for User losses on account of
                  any of the foregoing circumstances or compromised User Account
                  credentials.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Failure or disruption risks: You understand and agree that Your
                  access and use of the Platform is subject to certain technological
                  risks, too. We state that the policies, standards, systems, and
                  procedures on the Platform comply with the Applicable Law and
                  standard industry practices. The security policies, standards,
                  systems, and procedures are regularly reviewed and updated. Our
                  Services rely on the availability of internet and continual
                  operation of Our servers, which include third-party hardware and
                  software, all of which may suffer communication failures,
                  disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays that might affect your
                  ability to access and use the Services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintenance activities: Your access to and/or use of the Platform
                  may be interrupted, suspended or restricted (i) where We provide
                  maintenance, support, update or other services in relation to the
                  Platform; or (ii) by no fault of Ours, due to reasons attributable
                  to third parties. We will endeavour to notify You with reasonable
                  notice prior to performing any scheduled maintenance, support,
                  updates, repairs, or other services in relation to the Platform or
                  Services, if We expect that the intended activities will materially
                  disrupt the availability of the Platform or any of the Services. We
                  are not liable in the event You suffer any loss or damage by Your
                  inability to access the Platform on account of any of the foregoing
                  circumstances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Certain risks of blockchain technology: Your use of Your
                  Third-Party Wallet on the Platform is not under Our control or
                  influence and is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Users
                  are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key
                  associated with their Third-Party Wallets. We will not be able to
                  restore or issue any refund in respect of property lost or frozen
                  due to loss of private keys or otherwise. If a User is not able to
                  spend/use/withdraw their Earnings due to loss or theft of the
                  corresponding private key or otherwise, a User will be unable to
                  enjoy the benefits of such digital assets and We will not be liable
                  for the same in any manner whatsoever.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since the Platform does not provide the underlying Third-Party
                  Wallet software or blockchain nodes, such software constitutes an
                  essential third-party dependency without which transactions cannot
                  be exercised. We do not guarantee the continued operation,
                  maintenance, availability, or security of any of the foregoing or
                  the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), middleware and
                  servers of third parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The compatibility of the Platform with blockchain wallet
                  applications and devices or other third party applications and
                  devices is not intended as, and You hereby agree not to construe
                  such compatibility as, an endorsement or recommendation thereof or
                  a warranty or assurance regarding the fitness or security thereof.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the event that blockchain systems are adversely affected by
                  malfunctions, bugs, defects, hacking, theft, attacks, negligent
                  coding or design choices, or changes to the protocol rules of the
                  blockchain, Users may be exposed to a risk of total loss and
                  forfeiture of all relevant digital assets. We assume no liability
                  or responsibility for any of the foregoing matters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use of certain features and functionalities on the Platform may be
                  subject to payment of fees to third parties including but not
                  limited to payment gateways, our Service Providers, or Game
                  Partners. We do not receive such fees and have no ability to
                  reverse or refund any amounts paid in error.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fork handling: Blockchain and all Web3 digital assets may be
                  subject to "forks". Forks occur when some or all persons running
                  the software for a particular blockchain system adopt a new client
                  or a new version of an existing client that (a) changes the
                  protocol rules in backwards-compatible or backwards-incompatible
                  manner that affects which transactions can be added into later
                  blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other
                  matters relating to the future operation of the protocol, or (b)
                  reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the
                  blockchain. Some forks are "contentious" and thus may result in two
                  or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or
                  blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be the
                  legitimate or genuine continuation of the original.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We may not be able to anticipate, control or influence the
                  occurrence or outcome of forks, and do not assume any risk,
                  liability or obligation in connection therewith. We do not assume
                  any responsibility to notify any User of pending, threatened or
                  completed forks. Each User assumes full responsibility to
                  independently remain informed about possible forks, and to manage
                  its own interests and risks in that connection.
